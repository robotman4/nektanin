Hello! I'm Kim, a passionate IT professional with 15 years of experience in the tech industry. My journey has been driven by a love for technology, especially open-source solutions, Linux, and infrastructure. I believe in the power of automation and Infrastructure as Code to bring stability and efficiency to any project.

My work is rooted in clear goals and open, direct communication. I strive to understand the needs of my clients and deliver tested, reliable solutions that work. While I value tried-and-true methods, I'm always excited to explore and adopt new technologies that can offer innovative improvements.

As a DevOps enthusiast, I thrive on creating seamless integrations and automating processes to make life easier for everyone involved. Outside of work, I enjoy spending time with my family, which helps me maintain a healthy balance and brings stability to my life.

Iâ€™m here to bring your ideas to life with professionalism and a personal touch. Let's connect and see how we can work near seamlessly together!
